# FriendFinder
A survey that will match you to a 'friend' based off of user answers. Technologies used: Node, Express, various NPM packages.

This one was fun, but a bit tough. This homework was the definition of why I love and hate some of the homework assignments: it really makes you just sit down and stare at code. Through this, I was able to really come to a better understanding of how express routes and AJAX calls on the front end communicate, exchanging data per user interaction. In this case, user interaction includes surfing around the pages, taking the survey, and getting their best friend match back. I was able to finish just about everything, including a list of goofy pre-set friends, including various superheroes and Seinfeld characters. Let me know what you think!
